### Running Locally

#### Environment Variables

Before running the project, you'll need to set up the environment variables as specified in `.env.example`. Although it's recommended to use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables), a simple `.env` file will do the trick.

   ```bash
   pnpm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Link to Vercel and GitHub**: Run the following command to link your local instance with your Vercel and GitHub accounts. This will create a `.vercel` directory.

   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

3. **Pull Environment Variables**: Download your environment variables using Vercel CLI.

   ```bash
   vercel env pull
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Use pnpm to install all project dependencies.

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

5. **Run the Project**: Finally, run the development server.

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`. Happy coding!
